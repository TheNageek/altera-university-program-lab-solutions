# Altera University Program Lab Solutions

Lab exercises are currently being stored a the [FPGA Academy](https://fpgacademy.org/courses.html). This repository holds solutions to the exercises, it should be used as a reference should you not be able to find a solution on your own. 

Board used is the [DE1-SoC](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=836).

TODO(TheNageek): still need to finish Labs 4-11 and create videos.
